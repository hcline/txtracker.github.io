		<p class="c-text-primary">Our application uses <a class="t-strong" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/" target="_blank">PRO-CTCAE</a> measures to track Patient Reported Outcomes. Our application intelligently learns from the patient, and allows the medical team to prioritize symptoms so as to hone on what they are most interested in. We then compile this data in a simple, and intuitive interface that can be completed in under 2 minutes. We use this data to map out patient analytics to identify trends, and provide insightful data for medical teams.</p>
